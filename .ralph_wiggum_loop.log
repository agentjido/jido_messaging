3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1 (canonical topology with owner/strategy/restart intensity): implemented in `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:9` and matrix at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:35`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:20`.
- AC2 (fatal/recoverable/degraded crash matrix with guidance): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:51`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:38`.
- AC3 (SLO baselines + pressure thresholds mapped to telemetry dimensions): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:69`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:54`.
- AC4 (partitioning/sharding guidance for hot-path workers): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:87`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:68`.
- Evidence/traceability checks:
  - ST-OCM-000 row presence validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:91`.
  - downstream Story-00 references validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:98`.
  - architecture review block condition validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:84`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix precommit` cannot be left passing in current environment because:
  - plain `mix precommit` fails with Mix PubSub socket permission error (`:eperm`), and
  - with socket workaround, the repo has no `precommit` task/alias defined.
- Assumption: ST-OCM-000 is a documentation contract story; tests were added as documentation contract guards rather than runtime behavior tests.
** (Mix) The task "precommit" could not be found
1) changed files
- `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:94`  
Added an explicit hot-path partitioning row for ingest policy workers (Story 04+) in the canonical partition/sharding guidance.
- `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:6`  
Strengthened Story 00 spec tests from string checks to structural validations of topology/crash/SLO/partition tables, architecture review gate requirements, traceability row, and downstream Story 00 dependency references.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1 (topology defines owner/supervisor/strategy/restart intensity): validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:50`.
- AC2 (crash matrix with fatal/recoverable/degraded + handling): validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:89`.
- AC3 (SLO baselines + pressure thresholds + telemetry dimensions): validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:128`.
- AC4 (partitioning/sharding guidance for hot-path workers): doc updated at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:94`; validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:178`.
- Verification edge path (block missing crash/topology semantics): validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:215`.
- Evidence of done (traceability row + downstream references): validated in `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:233` and `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:240`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blockers: none.
- Assumption: ingest policy execution is part of expected hot-path worker partitioning for `ST-OCM-000`, so it was added explicitly to Story 00 guidance.

- `mix precommit` (final run passing: `629 tests, 0 failures, 5 skipped`)

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1: New callbacks are optional with deterministic defaults.
  - Added v2 optional callbacks and default wrappers in `JidoMessaging.Channel` (`listener_child_specs`, `extract_routing_metadata`, `verify_sender`, `sanitize_outbound`, `send_media`, `edit_media`, `extract_command_hint`, `edit_message`).
  - Covered in `test/jido_messaging/channel_test.exs` (`v2 optional callbacks default deterministically for v1-only channels`).
- AC2: First-party channels compile and existing behavior tests remain green.
  - First-party modules updated to `use JidoMessaging.Channel`.
  - `mix precommit` passes with all tests green.
- AC3: Capability declarations align with callback support and are testable.
  - Added `Channel.validate_capability_contract/1` with typed failures.
  - Added compile-time enforcement for modules using `use JidoMessaging.Channel`.
  - Added `:message_edit` only on channels that implement `edit_message/4` (Telegram/Discord/Slack).
  - Covered in `test/jido_messaging/channel_test.exs` (aligned/mismatch/unknown capability tests + first-party validation test).
- AC4: Callback failure classification is explicit.
  - Added typed callback failure envelope (`:class`, `:disposition`, `:reason`) and classification/disposition helpers.
  - Covered in `test/jido_messaging/channel_test.exs` (recoverable timeout => retry, raised exception => fatal/crash).

4) blockers/assumptions
- No blockers.
- Assumed capability atom names for v2 primitives from the story/spec text (no canonical atom list provided).
- Traceability row for `ST-OCM-001` already existed in `specs/stories/00_traceability_matrix.md`, so no matrix edit was needed.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1 (deterministic startup + child spec resolution): implemented in `InstanceSupervisor.start_instance_tree/2` with explicit channel resolution and ordered children (`InstanceServer`, reconnect worker, listener specs) in `lib/jido_messaging/instance_supervisor.ex:78`; verified by `instance startup resolves listener child specs deterministically and reports health` in `test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:235`.
- AC2 (bounded reconnect + telemetry): implemented in reconnect worker loop/backoff/telemetry in `lib/jido_messaging/instance_reconnect_worker.ex:87` and status hooks in `lib/jido_messaging/instance_server.ex:119`; verified by `recoverable failures trigger bounded reconnect with telemetry` in `test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:266`.
- AC3 (restart intensity + escalation policy): explicit domain/subtree restart limits set in `lib/jido_messaging/instance_supervisor.ex:15` and `lib/jido_messaging/instance_supervisor.ex:98`; crash-loop escalation tested in `test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:338`.
- AC4 (crash isolation across subtrees): isolation behavior tested in `test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:369` by crashing one instance worker and asserting unrelated instance server stays alive.
- Evidence of done (lifecycle/crash-isolation tests): added in `test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:1`.
- Traceability row already existed; no change required in `specs/stories/00_traceability_matrix.md`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- No blockers.
- Assumed supervisor `:DOWN` reason `:shutdown` is acceptable escalation evidence when restart intensity is exceeded, with supervisor PID replacement as the deterministic assertion (`test/jido_messaging/instance_lifecycle_runtime_test.exs:357`).

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1 (`Deliver` sends/edits through gateway APIs only):
  - `Deliver.deliver_outgoing/5` and `Deliver.send_to_room/5` now route through `JidoMessaging.OutboundGateway.send_message/4`.
  - Added `Deliver.edit_outgoing/5`, routed through `JidoMessaging.OutboundGateway.edit_message/5`.
  - `test/jido_messaging/deliver_test.exs` asserts send/edit gateway metadata + outbound completion telemetry.
- AC2 (partitioned workers with stable routing key):
  - Added partitioned gateway worker pool (`OutboundGateway.Supervisor` + `OutboundGateway.Partition`).
  - Stable route key: `instance_id <> ":" <> external_room_id` hashed via `route_partition/3`.
  - `test/jido_messaging/outbound_gateway_test.exs` verifies multi-room distribution and stable partition assignment.
- AC3 (queue bounds + pressure signals):
  - Per-partition bounded queue (`queue_capacity`) with `:queue_full` rejection.
  - Pressure transition telemetry on `[:jido_messaging, :pressure, :transition]` with level changes (`:normal/:warn/:degraded/:shed`).
  - `test/jido_messaging/outbound_gateway_test.exs` verifies queue rejection and `:shed` pressure transition.
- AC4 (normalized error categories for retry/terminal handling):
  - Added normalized taxonomy (`:retryable | :terminal | :fatal`) in gateway classification.
  - Retry loop only for retryable failures with bounded attempts/backoff.
  - Classification telemetry emitted on `[:jido_messaging, :outbound, :classified_error]`.
  - `test/jido_messaging/outbound_gateway_test.exs` verifies retryable classification, bounded retry behavior, and terminal give-up envelope.

4) blockers/assumptions
- No blockers.
- Assumption: scope for this story is `Deliver` integration; `Streaming`’s direct channel edit path was left unchanged.
