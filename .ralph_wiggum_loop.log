3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AC1 (canonical topology with owner/strategy/restart intensity): implemented in `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:9` and matrix at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:35`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:20`.
- AC2 (fatal/recoverable/degraded crash matrix with guidance): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:51`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:38`.
- AC3 (SLO baselines + pressure thresholds mapped to telemetry dimensions): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:69`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:54`.
- AC4 (partitioning/sharding guidance for hot-path workers): implemented at `specs/stories/00-runtime-topology-and-slos.md:87`; validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:68`.
- Evidence/traceability checks:
  - ST-OCM-000 row presence validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:91`.
  - downstream Story-00 references validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:98`.
  - architecture review block condition validated by `test/specs/story_00_runtime_topology_and_slos_test.exs:84`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix precommit` cannot be left passing in current environment because:
  - plain `mix precommit` fails with Mix PubSub socket permission error (`:eperm`), and
  - with socket workaround, the repo has no `precommit` task/alias defined.
- Assumption: ST-OCM-000 is a documentation contract story; tests were added as documentation contract guards rather than runtime behavior tests.
** (Mix) The task "precommit" could not be found
